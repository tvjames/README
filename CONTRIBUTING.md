# CONTRIBUTING

This may seem like a bit of a weird file to have, given the topic, but I welcome feedback. 

If you feel most comfortable raising an issue with me, by raising an issue, then that's okay, do it. 

If you feel I've missed something about myself, then send me a pull request. 

One Rule: I'm human, you're human. Let's treat each other well.
