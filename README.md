# Thomas James.README

This is an ever-work-in-progress _Manual For Me_. The background for this can be found in [Why and How to share your Manager README](https://medium.com/@kawomersley/why-and-how-to-share-your-manager-readme-plus-heres-mine-8a4fe188ee1b)

I'm somewhat just starting out at this, and in the interest of being open and transparent this seems like a great idea. This is very much a work in progress, and I'm always open to improvement. 

Disclaimer: This is my personal opinion, as best I can at honest self-reflection at the time it was written. It applies to me, and me alone. 

## Philosophy 

**Strong Opinions, Weakly Held.**

* Decisions & direction should not be made by committee, committees are for fact finding and open analysis
* Find the experts and listen to them, but never ignore the dissenting voice "that wont work because". 
* Everyone, regardless of position, deserves to be heard. 
* Challenge me
* "Face value" doesn't fly, mostly
* I make mistakes, you make mistakes, thats okay. Dont hide it. Learn from it.
* Respect is earned, this applies to me earning yours and you earning mine. 
* Forgive and forget. Grudges aren't worth it.

## Quirks 

* When in delivery mode, focused on the here and now. I don't want to hear about the grand vision for 2 years time. 
* Want to change my opinion, come to me with a well formulated argument that you can back up. Don't just tell me to "read this article", I might not come to the conclusion you are advocating for.
* Advocate with a well reasoned argument, expect me to question, I don’t expect answers right away, but don’t expect me to be convinced right away either.
* I avoid conflict, or perseved conflict. I'm trying to do better with this. 

## [Questions for our first 1:1](https://larahogan.me/blog/first-one-on-one-questions/)

### Grumpiness

_What makes you grumpy?_

Hunger, Certain amounts of tiredness, pointless meetings, pointless process/policy that is without adequite & explainable basis, needless distraction, saying one thing but doing another, not owning a mistake.

_How will I know when you’re grumpy?_

Short replies to questions, disinterest in social banter, possibly appearing distracted.

_How can I help you when you’re grumpy?_

Leave me alone to let it pass as it never lasts long, appropriate distraction

### Feedback & Recognition

_How do you like feedback - the medium (IRC, email, in person, etc.)_

Usually in person, probably in private, but public if it's something that needs me to address immidiately. Slack/email if I'm gumpy at the time. 

_How do you like feedback - routine like in 1:1s, or as-it-happens_

As close to as-it-happens after the stress has passed as must as possible. 

_How do you prefer to receive recognition? (public or private)_

Privately, it's almost never an individual contribution, and I do find recognition uncomfortable to receive. Recognition is never a motivator for me. 

### Goals and Support

_What makes 1:1s the most valuable for you?_

_What are your goals for this year? And for the next 3 months?_

_What do you need from your manager?_
_From your team? (this one is good if the 1:1 is with someone who manages people, but is typically relevant for IC’s, too)_
_From your peers? (outside the team)_

### The Wordy Question

_Human learning and growth requires the right amount of four things: new challenges, low ego, space to reflect and brainstorm, and timely and clear feedback. How are these four going for you? Is there one you need more or less of?_

### The Most Important Question

_What’s your favorite baked good, fruit and cake?_

Almond croissant/subway cookie, dragonfruit (from asia), Chocolate mud cake.
