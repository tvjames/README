# Thomas James.README

This is an ever-work-in-progress _Manual For Me_. The background for this can be found in [Why and How to share your Manager README](https://medium.com/@kawomersley/why-and-how-to-share-your-manager-readme-plus-heres-mine-8a4fe188ee1b)

I'm somewhat just starting out at this, and in the interest of being open and transparent this seems like a great idea. This is very much a work in progress, and I'm always open to improvement. 

Disclaimer: This is my personal opinion, as best I can at honest self-reflection at the time it was written. It applies to me, and me alone. 

## Philosophy 

**Strong Opinions, Weakly Held.**

* Family comes first, your family, my family. When you're worried/concerned/anxious about something family related (illness, argument, money, kids, school, whatever) then you're not going to be able to focus on work, so focus on your family and we've got your back. 
* Decisions & direction should not be made by committee, committees are for fact finding and open analysis
* We're a team, each of us has a role to play, each of us is just as important as the other, the work we do doesn't define us, but how we make each other better. Greater than the sum of the parts. 
* Find the experts and listen to them, but never ignore the dissenting voice "that wont work because". 
* Everyone, regardless of position, deserves to be heard. 
* Challenge me
* "Face value" doesn't fly, mostly
* I make mistakes, you make mistakes, thats okay. Dont hide it. Learn from it.
* You have my trust.
* Respect is earned, this applies to me earning yours and you earning mine. 
* Respect is earned by what we say but more often by what we do.
* Forgive and forget. Grudges aren't worth it.

## Quirks 

* When in delivery mode, focused on the here and now. I don't want to hear about the grand vision for 2 years time. 
* Want to change my opinion, come to me with a well formulated argument that you can back up. Don't just tell me to "read this article", I might not come to the conclusion you are advocating for.
* Advocate with a well reasoned argument, expect me to question, I don’t expect answers right away, but don’t expect me to be convinced right away either.
* I tend to avoid conflict, or perseved conflict. I'm trying to do better with this.
* I value receiving (candid) feedback well above my own ego

## Communication over Slack (or equivalent)

* I prefer to treat slack as an asynchronous communications tool, if time is of the essence please grab me at my desk or give me a call.
* When a conversation can be public (eg product discussions, work clarification), I would encourage that conversation to be held in a public channel. This enables others to benefit from the discussion, or to feel less alone if they also wanted to ask a similar question. Team/product/engineering channels are a great place for this. Keep DMs for private conversation, where it's only relevant/appropriate for the two parties. 
* I use the do-not-disturb (DND) feature, it's generally active from evening to early morning.
* Use threads to keep a conversation in the context of the original message, allowing the channel chat to carry on.

## [Questions for our first 1:1](https://larahogan.me/blog/first-one-on-one-questions/)

### Grumpiness

_What makes you grumpy?_

Hunger, Certain amounts of tiredness, pointless meetings, pointless process/policy that is without adequite & explainable basis, needless distraction, saying one thing but doing another, not owning a mistake.

_How will I know when you’re grumpy?_

Short replies to questions, disinterest in social banter, possibly appearing distracted.

_How can I help you when you’re grumpy?_

Leave me alone to let it pass as it never lasts long, appropriate distraction

### Feedback & Recognition

_How do you like feedback - the medium (IRC, email, in person, etc.)_

Usually in person, probably in private, but public if it's something that needs me to address immediately. Slack/email if I'm grumpy at the time. 

_How do you like feedback - routine like in 1:1s, or as-it-happens_

As close to as-it-happens after the stress has passed, as must as possible. 

_How do you prefer to receive recognition? (public or private)_

Privately, it's almost never an individual contribution, and I do find recognition uncomfortable to receive. Recognition is never a motivator for me. 

### Goals and Support

_What makes 1:1s the most valuable for you?_

The time put aside to listen to the people I work closely with. Getting to know them as people and not just as others that occupy a desk in the same place we work.

_What are your goals for this year? And for the next 3 months?_

_What do you need from your manager?_
_From your team? (this one is good if the 1:1 is with someone who manages people, but is typically relevant for IC’s, too)_
_From your peers? (outside the team)_

### The Wordy Question

_Human learning and growth requires the right amount of four things: new challenges, low ego, space to reflect and brainstorm, and timely and clear feedback. How are these four going for you? Is there one you need more or less of?_

### The Most Important Question

_What’s your favorite baked good, fruit and cake?_

Almond croissant/subway cookie, dragonfruit (or mango), chocolate mud cake. 

## My expectations of folks who report to me

## What you can expect of me as your manager

## What makes me, me

_What do I do in my spare time?_

* Hobbiest networking/homelab (routers, firewalls, etc). 
* Occasional gaming (adventure; think Myst, Obduction)
* Technophile life, gadgets, tinkering, researching, reading, learning

_What are my favourite movies?_

* Lock Stock and Two Smoking Barrels 
* Office Space (required watching for anyone in IT)
* The Fifth Element 
* Pulp Fiction

_What kind of games do I enjoy?_

* Adventure gaming mostly
* Towerfall, the fast paced, chaotic nature 

## Something you probably didn't expect about me

My wife and I were once avid [couchsurfing](https://www.couchsurfing.com/) hosts, 
opening our home to travellers wishing to stay with a local. Through this we've 
made friendships that continue today, people from all around the world and been 
encouraged to do things we otherwise might not have (like travelling to (Norway)
with a two-month-old.

## Finally, some values. 

This is a section I don't want to include above until I have a more solidified view of my own set of values. So in the meantime I'll borrow sets of values that I've stronly identified with. The first time I had an "epiphany" moment was when I joined Stacktrace, saw their list of values which evoked a "Yes! Those are the same things I also hold near". Are they truely my own, or just closely compatible enough to _feel_ like my own?

Here's a list of some. 

* Explicit is better than implicit
* Culture eats process for breakfast.
* Be curious, and ask.
* Kindness is better than correctness.
* Low quality is expensive. So is perfection. Be relentlessly pragmatic.
* Take an investment mindset, then offer tradeoffs.

I recent came across the [My Engineering Axioms](https://martinrue.com/my-engineering-axioms/) (along with a lot of other [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=25500815) reader - it's a good read either way) and found a few of those I thought might be values I can consider compatible with my own as well. 

* Your product is an asset, but code is a liability. - this is one I've come to feel strongly over the last decade - teams matter many times more that the code output they produce. 
* The longer you wait the more you'll know.
* The right team of people trumps everything else.
* It's OK to say "I don't know" or "I need to research that before I have an answer". - "I don't know" is a powerful phrase
* It's all about trade-offs.
* I consider it unethical to ask/require people to take AL for (reasonable) professional development. Professional development costs should be borne by the company, but this doesn't always need to be the case. It’s personally a non-negotiable for me that professional development is work time, without strings attached (i.e. the requirement to present to team internally etc).
